       "'under normal market conditions, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings made for investment purposes) in the stock of domestic and foreign issuers that are participating or benefitting from the development of the resources in the williston basin area (as described below) and/or mid-north america area, encompassing the states of arkansas, colorado, illinois, iowa, kansas, louisiana, minnesota, mississippi, missouri, montana, nebraska, new mexico, north dakota, oklahoma, south dakota, texas, wisconsin, and wyoming; and the canadian provinces of alberta, manitoba, and saskatchewan (herein referred to as the \"region\"); the \"williston basin area\" specifically encompasses western north dakota, northwestern south dakota, eastern montana, the southern portion of the canadian province of saskatchewan, and the southwestern portion of the canadian province of manitoba. to pursue this strategy, the fund invests primarily in companies that are (i) headquartered or maintain their principal place of business in the region, or (ii) during the issuer\\'s most recent fiscal year, derived at least 50% of their revenues from goods produced or sold, investments made, or services performed in the region, or (iii) during the issuer\\'s most recent fiscal year, have at least 50% of their assets in the region, each as determined at the time of purchase. the fund may invest in companies that have recently commenced operations and do not have significant revenues (development stage companies). the fund\\'s investment adviser, viking fund management, llc (the \"investment adviser\") will select investments it believes to have investment potential in the natural resources area (such as fossil fuels, agriculture, and minerals), as well as on the companies that service the region. the investment adviser anticipates that the fund will invest a significant amount (although not exclusively) in businesses in the extractive and/or agricultural sectors and in the companies that serve these sectors. the fund\\'s portfolio management team considers a variety of factors when choosing investments for the fund such as: (i) identifying companies and industries that appear to have the potential for above-average long-term performance based on projections of supply and demand of a resource and the state of the market; and/or (ii) identifying companies that are expected to show above-average growth over the long term as well as those that appear to be trading below their true worth. the fund\\'s portfolio management team will consider selling a security if its valuation target is achieved or if its business fundamentals have deteriorated.of the fund the fund invests, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings for investment purposes) in securities of issuers engaged primarily in energy-related industries. the fund invests primarily in equity securities. in complying with the 80% investment requirement, the fund may also invest in other investments that have economic characteristics similar to the fund’s direct investments, including derivatives, exchange-traded funds and american depositary receipts. these derivatives and other instruments may have the effect of leveraging the fund’s portfolio. the fund may invest up to 100% of its net assets in foreign securities. 1 invesco energy fund i-ene-sumpro-1 generally, the fund’s investments are divided among the four main energy subsectors: (1) major oil issuers; (2) energy services issuers; (3) oil and gas exploration/production issuers; and (4) natural gas and logistic pipeline issuers. these portfolio weightings may be adjusted depending on current economic conditions. in selecting securities for the fund, the portfolio managers use a research-oriented bottom-up investment approach, focusing on reasonably priced energy issuers with above average production volume growth, as well as earnings, cash flow and asset value growth potential independent of commodity pricing. the investment strategy focuses on identifying issuers with the ability to increase production while controlling costs by implementing new technologies, locating new discoveries (such as oil, natural gas, and/or coal) or boosting production volumes. in general, the fund emphasizes issuers that the portfolio managers believe are strongly managed and will generate above average long-term capital appreciation. the portfolio managers will consider selling a security of an issuer if, among other things, (1) a security reaches its price target; (2) a change in fundamentals occur—either issuer specific or industry wide; (3) a change in management occurs; or (4) a more attractive investment opportunity is identified. principal risks of investing in the fund as with any mutual fund investment, loss of money is a risk of investing. an investment in the fund is not a deposit in a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency. the risks associated with an investment in the fund can increase during times of significant market volatility. the principal risks of investing in the fund are: energy industry sector risk . the businesses in which the fund invests may be adversely affected by foreign, federal or state regulations governing energy production, distribution and sale. although individual security selection drives the performance of the fund, short-term fluctuations in commodity prices may cause price fluctuations in its shares. foreign securities risk . the value of the fund’s foreign investments may be adversely affected by changes in the foreign country’s exchange rates; political and social instability; changes in economic or taxation policies; difficulties when enforcing obligations; decreased liquidity; and increased volatility. foreign companies may be subject to less regulation resulting in less publicly available information about the companies. limited number of holdings risk . the fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in a limited number of securities or other instruments, which could negatively affect the value of the fund. management risk . the investment techniques and risk analysis used by the fund’s portfolio managers may not produce the desired results. market risk . the prices of and the income generated by the fund’s securities may decline in response to, among other things, investor sentiment; general economic and market conditions; regional or global instability; and currency and interest rate fluctuations. small- and mid-capitalization risk . stocks of small and mid sized companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse developments and may have little or no operating history or track record of success, and limited product lines, markets, management and financial resources. the securities of small and mid sized companies may be more volatile due to less market interest and less publicly available information about the issuer. they also may be illiquid or restricted as to resale, or may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes, all of which may cause difficulty when establishing or closing a position at a desirable price. sector fund risk . the fund’s investments are concentrated in a comparatively narrow segment of the economy, which may make the fund more volatile. performance information the bar chart and performance table provide an indication of the risks of investing in the fund. the bar chart shows changes in the performance of the fund from year to year as of december 31. the performance table compares the fund’s performance to that of a broad-based securities market benchmark, a style specific benchmark and a peer group

assets in foreign securities of issuers doing business in technology-related industries. 1 invesco technology fund i-tec-sumpro-1 in selecting securities for the fund, the portfolio managers use a research-oriented bottom-up investment approach, focusing on issuer fundamentals and growth prospects. security selection is then further refined by valuation and timeliness analysis. in general, the fund invests in issuers that the portfolio managers believe currently exhibit or will develop a sustainable competitive advantage, a free cash flow generating business model and strong returns on invested capital. technology issuers able to capitalize on the key secular themes identified by the portfolio managers are emphasized. valuation plays a critical role in the security selection process. the primary metric used by the portfolio managers to determine a security’s target valuation is cash flow. in addition to valuation analysis, the portfolio managers analyze product cycle and seasonality-driven measures to help determine the best time to purchase or sell a security. while the portfolio managers may invest in securities of any market capitalization, they tend to favor mid- and large-cap securities to avoid liquidity problems that can be associated with some small-cap securities. the resulting target portfolio consists of 40-60 individual securities. the portfolio managers will consider selling the security of an issuer if, among other things, (1) a security’s price reaches its valuation target; (2) an issuer’s fundamentals deteriorate; (3) it no longer meets the investment criteria; or (4) a more attractive investment opportunity is identified. principal risks of investing in the fund as with any mutual fund investment, loss of money is a risk of

technology-related industries. the fund invests primarily in equity securities. in complying with the 80% investment requirement, the fund may also invest in other investments that have economic characteristics similar to the fund’s direct investments, including derivatives, exchange-traded funds and american depositary receipts. these derivatives and other instruments may have the effect of leveraging the fund’s portfolio. the fund may invest up to 50% of its total assets in foreign securities of issuers doing business in technology-related industries. in selecting securities for the fund, the portfolio managers use a research-oriented bottom-up investment approach, focusing on issuer fundamentals and growth prospects. security selection is then further refined by valuation and timeliness analysis. in general, the fund invests in issuers that the portfolio managers believe currently exhibit or will develop a sustainable competitive advantage, a free cash flow generating business model and strong returns on invested capital. technology issuers able to capitalize on the key secular themes identified by the portfolio managers are emphasized. valuation plays a critical role in the security selection process. the primary metric used by the portfolio managers to determine a security’s target valuation is cash flow. in addition to valuation analysis, the portfolio managers analyze product cycle and seasonality-driven measures to help determine the best time to purchase or sell a security. while the portfolio managers may invest in securities of any market capitalization, they tend to favor mid- and large-cap securities to avoid liquidity problems that can be associated with some small-cap securities. the resulting target portfolio consists of 40-60 individual securities. the portfolio managers will consider selling the security of an issuer if, among other things, (1) a security’s price reaches its valuation target; (2) an issuer’s fundamentals deteriorate; (3) it no longer meets the investment criteria; or (4) a more attractive investment opportunity is identified. principal risks of investing in the fund as with any mutual fund investment,

identify dividend-paying issuers primarily within the electric utility, natural gas, water and telecommunications industries. the investment team emphasizes issuers with solid balance sheets and operational cash flow that supports sustained or increasing dividends. through fundamental research, financial statement analysis and the use of several valuation techniques, the management team estimates a target price for each security over a 2-3 year investment horizon. the portfolio managers then construct a portfolio which they believe provides the best combination of price appreciation potential, dividend income and risk profile. the portfolio managers consider whether to sell a particular security when any of these factors materially change. principal risks of investing in the fund

operating history or track record of success, and limited product lines, markets, management and financial resources. the securities of small and mid sized companies may be more volatile due to less market interest and less publicly available information about the issuer. they also may be illiquid or restricted as to resale, or may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes, all of which may cause difficulty when establishing or closing a position at a desirable price. sector fund risk . the fund’s investments are concentrated in a comparatively narrow segment of the economy, which may

market, based on estimated future earnings and cash flow. these companies generally have market values at valuation ratios, such as price-to-book and below market average, as defined by the s&p 500 index. in choosing individual securities, the subadviser screens a dynamic universe of the 500 largest publicly traded u.s. companies. (as of december 31, 2009, this included companies with market values above approximately $4.5 billion.) using fundamental research and a proprietary computer model, the subadviser ranks these companies from the cheapest to the most expensive on the basis of current share price to the subadviser’s estimate of normal long-term earnings power. as a result of the subadviser’s research and stock selection, the fund may focus on particular sectors of the economy. the subadviser’s management team intensively evaluates the cheapest companies to construct a portfolio of stocks that the

the fund will invest the majority of its total assets in the securities of companies in the mid-cap market capitalization range or in “special situations,” at the time of purchase. market capitalization is not a factor when determining whether companies are involved in “special situations.” the adviser defines special situations as companies undergoing unusual or possibly one-time developments that, in the opinion of the adviser, make them attractive for investment. the fund will not invest more than 20% of its total assets in securities of companies involved in actual or

focuses on those companies with sustainable cash flow and the ability to pay and grow dividends over time that the subadviser believes will deliver superior capital appreciation and income over the long term. the subadviser seeks to invest in companies that it believes: ÿ maintain competitive positions within their industries ÿ have strong company management implementing a solid business model ÿ generate attractive and sustainable cash flow ÿ have a commitment to dividends and dividend growth ÿ trade at prices below their future valuation targets the subadviser expects to invest the portfolio across a number of sectors with no single sector comprising more than three times the russell 1000 ® value index’s sector weighting or 40% of the total portfolio, whichever is lower. under normal market conditions, the fund expects to invest in approximately 60 to 80 companies with at least 80% of its net assets, plus borrowings for investment purposes, in a diversified portfolio of large cap equity securities. the fund’s 80% investment policy can be changed by the fund upon 60 days’ advance notice to shareholders. the fund may invest up to 20% of its total assets in the securities of foreign issuers, including issuers located or doing business in emerging markets.principal style characteristics: mid cap value stocks of companies with inexpensive fundamentals and recent momentum, relative to their peers the fund invests primarily in equity securities, principally common stocks, of mid cap companies that, in the subadviser’s opinion, are out of favor and thus undervalued in the marketplace at the time of purchase and have the potential for appreciation. we define mid cap companies as those with market capitalizations that fall within the range of the russell midcap ® index, provided that if the upper end of the capitalization range of that index falls below $15 billion, we will continue to define those companies with market capitalizations between the upper end of the range of the index and $15 billion as mid cap companies. as of december 31, 2009, the range of the index was $261 million to $15.5 billion, but it is expected to change frequently. the subadviser’s active investment strategy uses a quantitative investment model to evaluate and recommend investment decisions for the fund in a bottom-up, contrarian value approach. the primary components of the quantitative models are: ÿ indicators of fundamental undervaluation, such as low price-to-cash flow ratio or low price-to-earnings ratio, ÿ indicators of past negative market sentiment, such as poor past stock price performance, ÿ indicators of recent momentum, such as high recent stock price performance, and ÿ control of incremental risk relative to the benchmark index. all such indicators are measured relative to the overall universe of mid cap companies. under normal market conditions, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets, plus borrowings for investment purposes, in a diversified portfolio of equity securities of mid cap companies. the fund’s 80% investment policy can be changed by the fund upon 60 days’ advance notice to shareholders.principal style characteristics: small cap value stocks the fund invests primarily in equity securities, principally common and preferred stocks, of small cap companies. we define small cap companies as those with market capitalizations that fall within the range of the russell 2000 ® index, provided that if the upper end of the capitalization range of that index falls below $2.5 billion, we will continue to define those companies with market capitalizations between the upper end of the range of the index and $2.5 billion as small cap companies. as of december 31, 2009, the range of the index was $20 million to $5.6 billion, but it is expected to change frequently. the subadviser employs a value based investment style by seeking to identify companies with stocks trading at prices below what the subadviser believes are their intrinsic values. the subadviser uses a bottom-up approach, employing fundamental and qualitative criteria to identify individual companies for potential investment in the fund’s portfolio. the subadviser utilizes relationships with key analysts and industry experts to obtain unbiased and unique research perspectives. the subadviser employs statistical analysis, designed to seek to limit company specific risk in the fund’s portfolio. the fund’s sector weightings are a result of, and secondary to, individual stock selections. under normal market conditions, the fund expects to invest in approximately 55 to 70 companies with at least 80% of its net assets, plus borrowings for investment purposes, in a diversified portfolio of small cap equity securities. the fund’s 80% investment policy can be changed by the fund upon 60 days’ advance notice to shareholders.'"
